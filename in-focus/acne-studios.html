                        for how it expresses itself. If there was no better instance of this adage, it would be Acne
                        Studios - an acronym standing for ‘Ambition to Create Novel Expression’ - from which its
                        namesake does it derive a reason for being.</p>

            <div class="body-wrap copy-text">
                <p>Acne Studios started out from Stockholm in 1996 as a multidisciplinary creative collective, an
                    idea
                    which strongly nodded towards Andy Warhol’s Factory as influence. The early years would see the
                    collective simultaneously engage in various creative practices such as film and graphic design.
                    It
                    would only be a year later in 1997 that Jonny Johansson, its Founder and Creative Director,
                    would
                    bring Acne into fashion through the most iconic and democratic of garments - jeans. The denim
                    jean
                    as a monument of pop culture was important to Johansson, but just as important was how to do so
                    with
                    their own personal sensibilities.</p>
                <p>Those first jeans were done in distinctive red stitching and a flame logo which adorned their
                    right
                    back pockets. A 100 pairs would be made and shared to a 100 family and friends within the
                    creative
                    scene. Thus a cult was born - the jeans found feature in heavyweight cultural publications such
                    as
                    Wallpaper and Vogue just as they were exploring Scandinavian design at the time. A year later in
                    1998 would see Acne’s first full-fledged seasonal collection.</p>

            <div class="body-wrap copy-text">
                <p>That expansion has continued to progress over time as Acne Studios today - being more so than
                    just
                    denim - exists as an entirely contemporary brand. Acne’s approach succeeds today for its ability
                    to
                    propose interesting design and proportion into clothes without losing sight of its function. One
                    best describes this balance between those oft juxtaposing elements as lagom, a Swedish term to
                    mean
                    ‘just in the middle’.</p>
                <p>However big fashion has become, as a part of its identity, the brand remains just as involved
                    with
                    other modes of creative expression. Its Stockholm headquarters are housed in a grand old bank of
                    five stories which thus enables it to dabble in various disciplines such as furniture, kid’s
                    toys
                    and publishing in the pursuit of (novel) expression no matter the medium.</p>

            <div class="body-wrap copy-text">
                <p>This latter practice culminates in the form of a biannual magazine entitled as Acne Paper. It’s
                    printed in a large format, on matte paper and is austerely elegant in its visual layout. Much
                    lauded
                    for being more than just a commercial vehicle, and having an ‘organic and authentic’ curiosity
                    into
                    what is culturally relevant and interesting.</p>
                <p>These integrated crossover of disciplines run counter to how the playbook of running a fashion
                    house
                    goes. But it’s exactly this detachment from expectations and an outsider-in perspective on
                    fashion
                    by Johansson - who notably didn’t have a fashion education - which has garnered Acne its
                    credence of
                    cultish cool. The point serves to say that ‘Cool’ can’t be manufactured nor be engineered, it’s
                    instinctive and real.</p>
                <p>Then consider how far they’ve probably managed to shift a Millennial generation’s impression of a
                    word much associated with adolescent awkwardness, towards literally being an emblem of
                    Scandinavian
                    Cool. Now that, stands to be some feat in itself.</p>
