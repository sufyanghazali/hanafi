        <div class="body-wrap copy-text">
            <p>The 1970s and 80s came to be known as periods of fashion that tended towards glitzy
                glamour and the notion of power dressing - heavy-padded shouldered suits for the
                burgeoning executive class intent on expressing wealth with no apologies. These were
                after all, the heydays of Armani, Mugler and Versace.</p>

            <p>However, before minimalism would replace the excesses of glamour and wealth in
                the 1990s, Western fashion would be both awed and shocked by the arrival of the
                Japanese avant-garde onto the Parisian fashion scene. A trio of Yohji, Rei Kawakubo
                and Issey Miyake. Each proposed clothes that lent themselves to a radically different
                set of design ethos from Western contexts; challenging notions of beauty, gender and
                the functions of dress itself.</p>

            <p>Of the three, Issey arrived earliest, by establishing the Miyake Design Studio in 1970
                and showing his first collection through New York in 1971.</p>
            <p>He would complete his studies as a graphic designer at Tokyo’s Tama university
                during the early 60s. However, a belief in fashion as a serious endeavour of design
                later revealed itself when he posted a question to the head office of the World Design
                Conference upon realisation of fashion’s absence in the 1960 program. Issey would
                then leave for Paris in 1965, enrolling at the Chambre Syndicate de la Couture to learn
                how to make clothes, eventually cutting his teeth as a design assistant at Givenchy.</p>
            <p>A witnessing of the 1968 Parisian student protests would greatly influence his
                perspective about cloth-making; prompting a desire to create clothes which were
                democratic and appreciable to a global audience - opposing his early couture training
                and the clientele it served.</p>

            <!-- <img>  -->

            <p>A realist who ideally saw his approach to fashion as more akin to product design aside the more
                frivolous practices of
                his contemporaries, Issey would say:</p>
            <p class="blockquote">“In Paris we call the people who make clothing couturiers – they develop new
                clothing items – but actually the work of
                designing is to make something that works in real life.”</p>
            <p>Issey’s work looked for real solutions to contemporary lifestyles - informed by meticulous
                research
                into traditional
                production techniques and then how to wed them to new and contemporary technologies. It was
                about
                finding a path towards
                the future through the past as linked by the present.</p>
            <p>In 1991, the renowned American choreographer, William Forsythe approached Issey to create
                costumes
                for his upcoming
                production ‘The Loss of Small Detail’ for the Frankfurt Ballet. It would be a timely catalyst
                for
                Issey to apply his
                work on ‘pleating’ as a medium towards clothes that would allow for freedom in movement. Some
                further experimentation
                and revisions later, led to the birth of PLEATS PLEASE as a standalone line in 1993.</p>

            <!-- <img>  -->
            <!-- <img>  -->

            <p>PLEATS PLEASE would be a terrific revolution against traditional methods of pleating - where
                fabrics
                were pleated first,
                cut then sewn as a finished garment. Often, these pleats were non-permanent and had to be reset
                after repeated washes.
                Issey Miyake’s approach involved cutting a full garment up to three times larger than the final
                article, and then fed
                through a heat press whilst sandwiched between two layers of washi paper. The use of 100%
                high-quality polyester also
                ensured the permanence of the pleats due to the material’s thermoplastic qualities.</p>
            <p>The range advocated styles that were ‘light, ageless, trans-seasonal, cross-cultural and
                ambisexual’
                and rendered in a
                diverse range of colours. This coupling of versatile styling and easy care - the polyester lets
                it
                be machine washed,
                tumbled, scrunched and yet miraculously return to its original crisp state - would be blessing
                to
                the cosmopolitan
                traveller, dancer or anyone conscious to good design. Practical yet elegant, it seemed perfectly
                suited to the diverse
                needs of modern lifestyles.</p>

            <!-- <img>  -->

            <p>And when design can be such, as a solution to the everyday lives of many people, it speaks
                absolutely
                to freedom and a
                humanist spirit. Revolutionary? Yes, but also, entirely needed today.</p>
