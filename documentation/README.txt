Compositions page:
- Implemented directional resize on single click
- Only resizes in the center if the image is exactly in the center
    - can change to make it so its within a range
- Resize factor is 1.5, animation is 0.2s
- On hover, border darkens; animation is 0.2s
- Can get rid of animations

suggestions:
1. single click = bring to front

2. the enlarge on the click is jarring. switch to just like the index boxes, make drag resizes it. but only to enlarge; make simple by drag right to enlarge in one direction; bottom right corner. so if u drag it back u return to og size.

3. the design is for a certain desktop size right ? for the enlargement, make the max height like the screen size's max height so it doesn't go further.

3.1. for that smallest picture. just make the default slightly larger like 120% and the enlarge like 140%

4. keep border. remove animations.


Synthetic page:

- plays on click
- keeps playing until track ends
- if another one is clicked, it plays on top
